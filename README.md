> Terminal version of the game "2048" written in C++.

:tada: Featured on GitHub's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/github/status/1017094930991370240) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GitHub/videos/1433491453419807/) pages! :tada:

## Setup

The game and code is made to run natively on the GNU/Linux and MacOS platforms, but cross-platform compatibility for Windows has been added too.

### Requirements

* C++11 compiler (e.g. `g++`, `clang++`, `pgc++`, `icpc`, etc.)
* Virtually any platform including:
  * Linux
  * MacOS
  * Windows (via Cygwin or Windows Subsystem for Linux)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/)

### Installation

1. Open your terminal in your preferred directory and clone this project:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/plibither8/2048.cpp
```
2. Enter the project's build directory:
```sh
cd 2048.cpp/build
```

---

For both CMake and Meson, the default C++ compiler on your system will be used.
If you wish to manually select a C++ compiler, optionally add `CXX=clang++ cmake` or `CXX=clang++ meson` etc.

#### Building with CMake

3. Generate build configuration
```sh
cmake ../
```
4. Build the executable
```sh
cmake --build .
```
5. Install the program (optional)
```sh
cmake --build . --target install
```

6. Run the program and play the game! :tada:
```sh
2048    # run `./2048` if game is not installed
```

<p align="center">
    <b>OR</b>
</p>

#### Building with Meson

3. Generate build configuration
```sh
meson ../
```
4. Build the executable
```sh
ninja
```
5. Install the program (optional)
```sh
meson configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
ninja install
```

6. Run the program and play the game! :tada:
```sh
2048    # run `./2048` if game is not installed
```

## Contributing

First of all, thank you for contributing :smile:! A few things to note:

* If you have found a bug, or have a feature that you'd like implemented, [raise an issue](https://github.com/plibither8/2048.cpp/issues).

* If you have proposed a pull request, make sure that you run `clang-format` on the source code (both, `.cpp` and `.hpp`) files if you've made changes there.

* In your local repository, run `git update-index --skip-worktree ./data/*.txt` to ensure that changes to the data files are not tracked by git, and thus are not staged.

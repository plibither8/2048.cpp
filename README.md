## Notes

* Game board array is defined as `board[y][x]`
* Game board will follow the following structure:

```plaintext
'x' => x-axis OR the horizontal line OR columns
'y' => y-axis OR the vertical line OR rows
```

### Example

`board[2][0]` refers to the 0th tile (or column) in 2nd row as in this case, x = 0 and y = 2. The specific tile is denoted the by '@' symbol in the following gameboard:

> Note: `row` and `column` indexing starts at 0.

```plaintext
┌──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
│      │      │      │      │
├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
│      │      │      │      │
├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
│   @  │      │      │      │
├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
